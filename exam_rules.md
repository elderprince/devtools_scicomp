# Final project
- The final exam consists of a project to be chosen from [this list](exam_projects.md).
- For projects marked as *complex*, students may work in groups of up to **2** people.
- The code should expose unit tests to ensure correctness.
- **Throughout** the project, students must work with `git` (using the same structure as seen during the practical sessions) and store their code on their `devtools_scicomp_project_2025` GitHub repository (branch `main`).
- The maximum score for the final project is **25**.
- **Bonus**: Implementing CI/CD pipelines, showcasing results of profiling, optimization, using parallel computing techniques, or running on computational clusters may contribute additional points.

# Practical sessions
- Completing exercises from the practical sessions contributes up to **5 additional points** to the final grade.

The maximum achievable grade for the exam is **30**. Honors may be granted in exceptional cases.

# Deliverables
1. The GitHub repository **must** include a `README.md` file reporting the project chosen, the design choices, the techniques used, and the results obtained.
2. Upon completion, students must send an email to **both** the instructor and the assistant, including:
   - Their full name;
   - The course they are enrolled in;
   - The link to their GitHub repository.
3. **Bonus**: Documenting the package may contribute additional points.
